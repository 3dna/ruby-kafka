module Kafka

  # @note This code is still alpha level. Don't use this for anything important.
  #   The API may also change without warning.
  #
  # A client that consumes messages from a Kafka cluster in coordination with
  # other clients.
  #
  # A Consumer subscribes to one or more Kafka topics; all consumers with the
  # same *group id* then agree on who should read from the individual topic
  # partitions. When group members join or leave, the group synchronizes,
  # making sure that all partitions are assigned to a single member, and that
  # all members have some partitions to read from.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # A simple producer that simply writes the messages it consumes to the
  # console.
  #
  #     require "kafka"
  #
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(seed_brokers: ["kafka1:9092", "kafka2:9092"])
  #
  #     # Create a new Consumer instance in the group `my-group`:
  #     consumer = kafka.consumer(group_id: "my-group")
  #
  #     # Subscribe to a Kafka topic:
  #     consumer.subscribe("messages")
  #
  #     begin
  #       # Loop forever, reading in messages from all topics that have been
  #       # subscribed to.
  #       consumer.each_message do |message|
  #         puts message.topic
  #         puts message.partition
  #         puts message.key
  #         puts message.value
  #         puts message.offset
  #       end
  #     ensure
  #       # Make sure to shut down the consumer after use. This lets
  #       # the consumer notify the Kafka cluster that it's leaving
  #       # the group, causing a synchronization and re-balancing of
  #       # the group.
  #       consumer.shutdown
  #     end
  #
