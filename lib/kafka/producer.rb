module Kafka

  # Allows sending messages to a Kafka cluster.
  #
  # == Buffering
  #
  # The producer buffers pending messages until {#flush} is called. Note that there is
  # a maximum buffer size (default is 1,000 messages) and writing messages after the
  # buffer has reached this size will result in a BufferOverflow exception. Make sure
  # to periodically call {#flush} or set +max_buffer_size+ to an appropriate value.
  #
  # Buffering messages and sending them in batches greatly improves performance, so
  # try to avoid flushing after every write. The tradeoff between throughput and
  # message delays depends on your use case.
  #
  # == Error Handling and Retries
  #
  # The design of the error handling is based on having a {MessageBuffer} hold messages
  # for all topics/partitions. Whenever we want to flush messages to the cluster, we
  # group the buffered messages by the broker they need to be sent to and fire off a
  # request to each broker. A request can be a partial success, so we go through the
  # response and inspect the error code for each partition that we wrote to. If the
  # write to a given partition was successful, we clear the corresponding messages
  # from the buffer -- otherwise, we log the error and keep the messages in the buffer.
  #
  # After this, we check if the buffer is empty. If it is, we're all done. If it's
  # not, we do another round of requests, this time with just the remaining messages.
  # We do this for as long as +max_retries+ permits.
  #

    # @param broker_pool [BrokerPool] the broker pool representing the cluster.
    #

    #

    #   replicas to acknowledge a write before responding with a timeout.
    #
    # @param required_acks [Integer] The number of replicas that must acknowledge
    #   a write.

    #   original attempt.

    # @param retry_backoff [Integer] the number of seconds to wait between retries.

    # Writes a message to the specified topic. Note that messages are buffered in
    # the producer until {#flush} is called.
    #
    # == Partitioning
    #
    # There are several options for specifying the partition that the message should
    # be written to.
    #
    # The simplest option is to not specify a message key, partition key, or
    # partition number, in which case the message will be assigned a partition at
    # random.
    #
    # You can also specify the +partition+ parameter yourself. This requires you to
    # know which partitions are available, however. Oftentimes the best option is
    # to specify the +partition_key+ parameter: messages with the same partition
    # key will always be assigned to the same partition, as long as the number of
    # partitions doesn't change. You can also omit the partition key and specify
    # a message key instead. The message key is part of the message payload, and
    # so can carry semantic value--whether you want to have the message key double
    # as a partition key is up to you.
    #
    # @param value [String] the message data.
    # @param key [String] the message key.
    # @param topic [String] the topic that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition [Integer] the partition that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition_key [String] the key that should be used to assign a partition.
    #
    # @raise [BufferOverflow] if the maximum buffer size has been reached.
    # @return [nil]

      unless buffer_size < @max_buffer_size
        raise BufferOverflow, "Max buffer size #{@max_buffer_size} exceeded"
      end

      if partition.nil?
        # If no explicit partition key is specified we use the message key instead.
        partition_key ||= key
        partitioner = Partitioner.new(@broker_pool.partitions_for(topic))

    #
    # Depending on the value of +required_acks+ used when initializing the producer,
